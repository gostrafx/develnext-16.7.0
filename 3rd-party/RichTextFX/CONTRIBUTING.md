## Merging pull requests

Commiters can merge pull requests. If you are a committer, please follow these (rather informal) rules when merging a pull request:

 - When a pull request is a no brainer (by your best judgment), go ahead and merge it.
 - When in doubt, seek an opinion of at least one more committer and work with the proponent of the PR until all involved committers (including you) give a :+1:.
