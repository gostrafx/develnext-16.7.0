  Plays the sound, looping. If the sound is already playing, it will be played again, concurrently.
  You need to stop the sound via a call to stop(long) using the returned id.

  :param $volume: :doc:`double </api_en/.types/double>`  - (optional)
  :param $pitch: :doc:`double </api_en/.types/double>`  - (optional)
