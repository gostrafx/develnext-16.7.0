-------------

JPHP is a new implementation for PHP which uses the Java VM. It supports many features of the PHP language (5.4+).
How does it work? JPHP is a compiler like ``javac``, it compiles php sources to JVM bytecode and then can execute the result on the Java VM.

.. note::

    Supports: JDK 1.6+ (OpenJDK, Oracle), Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.
